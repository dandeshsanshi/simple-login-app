Here's a sample DevOps project from scratch, which includes a simple application hosted in Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, and the necessary steps to set everything up. This project will display a login page when accessed.

Project Overview:
Application: A basic Node.js app with a simple login page.
Infrastructure: Kubernetes cluster (using Minikube for local testing) and deployment configuration.
IaC: Terraform for provisioning Kubernetes infrastructure.
CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automating the deployment process.
